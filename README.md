## Features

### Target Container System

- Right-click any container (except key rings) to set it as your target container

- Crafted and dismantled items will automatically transfer to the target container if there's room
- If the target container is full or not set, items will go to the default target (configurable from the PI2AB tab in the character panel)
- To reset your target container, right-click the main character inventory and select "Reset Target Container"

### Configuration

![PI2AB table in the character panel.](https://github.com/amescodes/PZPI2AB/blob/main/images/configtab.png)

The mod adds a new "PI2AB" tab in your character info panel with several options:

#### When to Transfer Items

When crafting/dismantling multiple items at once ("All" option), you can choose when the items get transferred:

- **After Each**: Items are transferred immediately after each individual craft/dismantle task
- **At End**: Items are transferred only after all crafting/dismantling tasks are completed

#### Default Target

When there's no target container set or when the target container is full, items will be transferred to the default target. You have two options:

- **Player Inventory**: Items go to your main inventory (default setting)
- **Item Source Container**: Items return to the container where one of the crafting ingredients came from
